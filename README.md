This repository includes various Jupyter Notebooks to help with ENPA analysis.

## Getting Started
The Getting Started notebook provides an introduction to leveraging the ENPA REST APIs to download and analyze data for your jurisdiction by 1) generating an API key, 2) downloading ENPA data, and 3) visualizing the downloaded data.

## Roll Your Own Analysis (Coming Soon)
The Roll Your Own Analysis notebook demonstrates how to download raw data from the ENPA REST API, debias it, and display a basic visualization by 1) downloading raw ENPA data, 2) debiasing raw data, and 3) visualizing the debiased data.
